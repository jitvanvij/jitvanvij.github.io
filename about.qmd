# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Jitvan Vij

I'm a graduate student at Boston University, specializing in Data Analytics, Business Intelligence, and Simulation Modeling.

With hands-on experience in Python, R, Spark, and AWS, I work at the intersection of data and decision-making. My background includes working on real-world projects in data mining, cloud-based data engineering, and Monte Carlo simulations.

When Iâ€™m not building models, I enjoy exploring productivity tools and deep diving into basketball analytics.
